    <p>On an August monday, I came home from work and made myself a nice dinner and tidied my apartment. Sunlight in my condo and a life to live and a stack of
        books to finish, I picked up my copy of Kahlil Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i> and headed out to my favourite Japanese cafe. It took me an hour to finish.

    <p> The village gathers around a man who has called a ship to take him home, they ask him questions about the many different feelings of life. He tells 
        them how they should approach feelings such as joy, beauty, labour, pain, family. Not a single word is wasted. A meditation on life and an easy recommendation.
