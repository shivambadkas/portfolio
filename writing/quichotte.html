        Quichotte quickly become one of my favourite reads, Salman Rushdie’s 2019 novel inspired by Don Quixote is an inspiring and heartwarming novel about family and identity. 
        The novel at its core follows Ismail Smile - a travelling salesman of pharmaceuticals on his quest to win the affections of a television talk show host.
         His adventures across America present a satire on the sphere of the (first?) Donald Trump era of America, and careful plot and character development that 
         Rushdie is famed for shines through again and again. This work seems to be a reflection of Rushdie at the height of his powers and begs the question - does one need to 
         understand the author to understand this work? Salman Rushdie is perhaps the author with the most notoriety and fame in the modern age, and his ideas and characters set 
         him echelons above his peers. The family lives of the characters in this novel are the most memorable for me personally, there is an instance of a longing love for a family 
        member which are the primary drivers of emotion in this novel. The parallel stories of Quichotte - Ismail Smile - and the author who is writing him, Samuel Duchamp, and their
        quest to achieve the love they have lived their whole lives without finding is a sobering reminder of the fragility of familial relationships. My favourite part was probably the
        rekindling of Quichottes and his sisters’ relationships; she achieved success as a lawyer in London whilst he struggled in his own career. His pride and refusal to admit fault in a small argument
        robbed them both of a family life for many decades. Another perhaps more gruesome revelations was the family history, one of the reasons of conflict was the history of assault in the family, and how the protagonist lived his whole
        life in ignorance of it and how it shattered the way he remembered his family. It shows that even amongst the ones you hold dearest to your heart there can be secrets and once they are released they can change an individuals’ perception of their lives forever. 
        The novel ties beautifully together the fentanyl epidemic, corporate pharmaceutical corruption, celebrity obsession, magical realism, political commentary, and especially family relationships. The fluid and easy manner in which Rushdie foreshadows
        and unravels the plot is a testament to his skill, and Quichotte is a return to form. I do not think you need to read his other books to enjoy this one.
